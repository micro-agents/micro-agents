# Micro-Agent Platform

µ² is a multi-agent, and in particular a micro-agent platform. It targets the construction of arbitrary applications using efficiently communicating micro-agents, dynamic binding of agents based on their capabilities. Alternatively numerous addressing patterns useful in the context of both agent-based applications as well as simulations are provided. The platform further provides comprehensive network support which allows the platform's use as a middleware for arbitrary applications. Applications developed for desktop machines can mostly be run on mobile devices, including communication between desktop and mobile version.
